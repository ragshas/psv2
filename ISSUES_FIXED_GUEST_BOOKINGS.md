# Issues Fixed: Guest Bookings & My Account Link 🎉

## Problems Resolved

### 1. ✅ **My Account Link Fixed**
- **Issue**: `BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'services'`
- **Root Cause**: Account template using incorrect route name `'services'` instead of `'services.services_list'`
- **Fix**: Updated `app/templates/account/profile.html` line 97
- **Result**: My Account page now loads without errors

### 2. ✅ **Guest Bookings Implemented**
- **Issue**: Users had to register/login to make bookings
- **Enhancement**: Now supports both registered users AND guest bookings
- **Result**: Anyone can book services without creating an account

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Database Updates
- **Modified Booking Model**:
  - Made `user_id` nullable (supports guest bookings)
  - Added `guest_name`, `guest_email`, `guest_phone` fields
  - Added helper methods: `get_customer_name()`, `is_guest_booking()`
  - Applied database migration successfully

### Route Changes
- **Removed `@login_required`** from `new_booking()` route
- **Enhanced booking logic** to handle both user types:
  - Registered users: Uses `user_id`
  - Guest users: Uses guest fields with `user_id = None`
- **Updated validation** to require name/email for guest bookings

### Template Enhancements
- **Dynamic Booking Form**:
  - Shows guest info fields when not logged in
  - Organized into sections (Your Information + Appointment Details)
  - Proper validation for both user types

- **Enhanced Booking Lists**:
  - Displays guest bookings with "Guest" badge
  - Shows guest email for admin view
  - Proper customer name display for both types

### UI Improvements
- **New CSS Sections**:
  - `.guest-info-section` and `.appointment-section` styling
  - `.guest-badge` for visual identification
  - `.customer-email` display formatting
  - Responsive section layouts

### Services Page Update
